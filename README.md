This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4)  Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.


### Development workflow

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

## Application Theming

Polymer 1.0 introduces a shim for CSS custom properties. We take advantage of this in `app/styles/app-theme.html` to provide theming for your application. You can also find our presets for Material Design breakpoints in this file.

[Read more](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/docs/devguide/styling.html) about CSS custom properties.

## Unit Testing

Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience.

[Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#html-suites) about using Web Component tester.

## Dependency Management

Polymer uses [Bower](http://bower.io) for package management. This makes it easy to keep your elements up to date and versioned. For tooling, we use npm to manage Node.js-based dependencies.

## Service Worker

Polymer Starter Kit offers an optional offline experience thanks to Service Worker and the [Platinum Service Worker elements](https://github.com/PolymerElements/platinum-sw). New to Service Worker? Read the following [introduction](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/) to understand how it works.

Our optional offline setup should work well for relatively simple applications. For more complex apps, we recommend learning how Service Worker works so that you can make the most of the Platinum Service Worker element abstractions.

### Enable Service Worker support?

To enable Service Worker support for Polymer Starter Kit project use these 3 steps:

1. Uncomment Service Worker code in index.html
  ```HTML
  <!-- Uncomment next block to enable Service Worker support (1/2) -->
  <!--
  <paper-toast id="caching-complete"
               duration="6000"
               text="Caching complete! This app will work offline.">
  </paper-toast>

  <platinum-sw-register auto-register
                        clients-claim
                        skip-waiting
                        on-service-worker-installed="displayInstalledToast">
    <platinum-sw-cache default-cache-strategy="networkFirst"
                       precache-file="precache.json">
    </platinum-sw-cache>
  </platinum-sw-register>
  -->
  ```
2. Uncomment Service Worker code in elements.html

  ```HTML
  <!-- Uncomment next block to enable Service Worker Support (2/2) -->
  <!--
  <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/platinum-sw/platinum-sw-cache.html">
  <link rel="import" href="../bower_components/platinum-sw/platinum-sw-register.html">
  -->
  ```
3. Add 'precache' to the list in the 'default' gulp task like below.
[(gulpfile.js)](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/gulpfile.js)

  ```JavaScript
  // Build Production Files, the Default Task
  gulp.task('default', ['clean'], function (cb) {
    runSequence(
      ['copy', 'styles'],
      'elements',
      ['jshint', 'images', 'fonts', 'html'],
      'vulcanize', 'precache',
      cb);
  });
  ```

#### Filing bugs in the right place

If you experience an issue with Service Worker support in your application, check the origin of the issue and use the appropriate issue tracker:

* [sw-toolbox](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/sw-toolbox/issues)
* [platinum-sw](https://github.com/PolymerElements/platinum-sw/issues)
* [platinum-push-notifications-manager](https://github.com/PolymerElements/push-notification-manager/)
* For all other issues, feel free to file them [here](https://github.com/polymerelements/polymer-starter-kit/issues).

#### I get an error message about "Only secure origins are allowed"

Service Workers are only available to "secure origins" (HTTPS sites, basically) in line with a policy to prefer secure origins for powerful new features. However http://localhost is also considered a secure origin, so if you can, developing on localhost is an easy way to avoid this error. For production, your site will need to support HTTPS.

#### How do I debug Service Worker?

If you need to debug the event listener wire-up use `chrome://serviceworker-internals`.

#### What are those buttons on chrome://serviceworker-internals?

This page shows your registered workers and provides some basic operations.

* Unregister: Unregisters the worker.
* Start: Starts the worker. This would happen automatically when you navigate to a page in the worker's scope.
* Stop: Stops the worker.
* Sync: Dispatches a 'sync' event to the worker. If you don't handle this event, nothing will happen.
* Push: Dispatches a 'push' event to the worker. If you don't handle this event, nothing will happen.
* Inspect: Opens the worker in the Inspector.

#### Development flow

In order to guarantee that the latest version of your Service Worker script is being used, follow these instructions:

* After you made changes to your service worker script, close all but one of the tabs pointing to your web application
* Hit shift-reload to bypass the service worker as to ensure that the remaining tab isn't under the control of a service worker
* Hit reload to let the newer version of the Service Worker control the page.

If you find anything to still be stale, you can also try navigating to `chrome:serviceworker-internals` (in Chrome), finding the relevant Service Worker entry for your application and clicking 'Unregister' before refreshing your app. This will (of course) only clear it from the local development machine. If you have already deployed to production then further work will be necessary to remove it from your user's machines.

#### Disable Service Worker support after you enabled it

If for any reason you need to disable Service Worker support after previously enabling it, you can remove it from your Polymer Starter Kit project using these 4 steps:

1. Remove references to the platinum-sw elements from your application [index](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/app/index.html).
2. Remove the two Platinum Service Worker elements (platinum-sw/..) in [app/elements/elements.html](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/app/elements/elements.html)
3. Remove 'precache' from the list in the 'default' gulp task ([gulpfile.js](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit/blob/master/gulpfile.js))
4. Navigate to `chrome://serviceworker-internals` and unregister any Service Workers registered by Polymer Starter Kit for your app just in case there's a copy of it cached.

own local setup.
